- noisy-numbers.txt is a plain text file with dummy data for 10 digit phone numbers with some lines containing fewer than 10 digits.

- license-plates.txt is a plain text file with dummy data for 7 digit license plates. Some lines contain 3 letters 
and 4 numbers, others contain a mix of 7 letters and numbers.
